## Project Style Guide

When working on this project, please follow the following style guidelines:

### Use Semantic Elements

Whenever possible, make use of semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and provide meaningful structure to your code.

For example, instead of using `<div>` elements for the restaurant cards, consider using `<article>` elements to convey that each card represents a self-contained composition in the document.

### Apply Vertical Distancing

Apply vertical spacing and group related code together to improve code readability. Grouping related code helps to create a more cohesive and maintainable codebase.

### CSS Naming Convention

Please follow the [BEM (Block Element Modifier)](https://getbem.com/) naming methodology for CSS. This convention helps to organize and structure CSS classes, making it easier to style and maintain components.

## Notes

- The Persian font was not included due to potential license issues.
